ABOUT
~~~~~

git-logn is a minor mode for emacs that uses "git blame" to highlight the
last 2 days worth of commits for any file that you enable it for.

It's heavily based on git-blame.el, and is unabashedly ripped off from that file.

It's exactly like git-blame, except:
- It only shows commits from the last 2 days
- It uses a predictable "lighter to darker" highlighting scheme.  Newer
  commits are lighter colored.
- It doesn't show the commit details in the editor, but still does when you
  hover with the mouse.

SETUP
~~~~~

Add the following to your .emacs.d/init.el:

(defun my-git-logn-hook()
  (require 'git-logn)
  (git-logn-mode 't)
  )

And then for any mode where you want to enable git-logn:

(add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'my-git-logn-hook)
